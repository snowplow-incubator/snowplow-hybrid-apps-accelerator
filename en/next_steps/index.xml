Have tracking set-up Have some data in the ATOMIC.EVENTS table Have a working dbt project with the mobile model configurations for the sample data Step 1: Complete refresh of your Snowplow mobile package (Optional) If you would like to use your current dbt environment that you set-up during modelling the sample data you might want to start from scratch.
While you can drop and recompute the incremental tables within this package using the standard --full-refresh flag, all manifest tables are protected from being dropped in production.</description>
